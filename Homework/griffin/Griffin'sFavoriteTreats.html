                <h1>Griffin's Tasty Treats</h1>
                <h2>Peanut Butter Crunchies</h2>
                <p>

Does your dog love peanut butter as much as Griffin does? If so, this recipe will have your him jumping for joy!  It’s a staple of the Manilove house. You’ll need 2 cups of flour, 1/2 cup peanut butter and 2 eggs.</p>
<ol >
<li> Preheat your oven to 350 F. </li>
<li> Mix together your flour, peanut butter & eggs in a large bowl until slightly combined.</li>
<li> Add in a little bit of water (approximately one Tbsp at a time) until the mixture becomes wet enough to roll out as dough.</li>
<li> Roll out your dough & cut out your favorite shapes with some cookie cutters. </li>
<li>Place your treats onto your baking sheet & cook for about 15 minutes. For a little bit of crunch I like to take mine out just as the bottoms start to darken.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Sweet Potato Crisps</h2>

This tasty treat is a great way for Griffin to get his veggies in a way that he enjoys! Try these healthy sweet potato crisps for your pup at home!</P>
