                <h1>The Story of Griffin</h1>

<p>It is anyone’s guess how Griffin spent the first 2 or 3 years of his life, but on March 2, 2017 his life changed and so did all of ours. All we can do is start from his new beginning as part of the Manilove family. Griffin was very important to someone else, solely based on his aptitude about himself and the world around him. He walks with confidence, rolls over for belly rubs and loves to play!</p>

<p> The story from Dachshund Rescue of South Florida, the organization who rescued him, is that he was found off of Griffin Road in Hollywood, Florida. He was found wandering the streets with no collar or ids. A family that had 2 dogs took him in and started looking to see if they could find his forever family. They brought him to Dachshund Rescue of South Florida. They found no micro chip and put out the proper notices to see if someone was looking for him. </p>

<p> The Manilove’s, Griffin’s new permanent family, were distraught after the loss of their Beagle to cancer. They reached out to different rescue agencies looking for pups in need. The next day, Griffin’s and the Manilove’s lives both changed for the better. Griffin was the perfect match and now could not have it any better! He has a daddy that wont let anything happen to him, a mom making sure he doesn’t miss a single meal, and a brother who comes home from college and incessantly plays with him. He’s a lucky guy! </p>
