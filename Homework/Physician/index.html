You just came from the hustle and bustle of undergrad, so ease the transition by making a solid group of friends at your medical program. Some say that making friends outside of your program is the best way to ensure a work/life balance and that it eliminates the competitiveness in your friendships. <br> <br> One good thing about medical school is that it really is only 'school school' for the first two years. The next two will be spent in rotations to really expose you to different elements of the field. If you still have any energy (unlikely) then it is now time to obtain that sought after medical degree. Click the next button!" );
